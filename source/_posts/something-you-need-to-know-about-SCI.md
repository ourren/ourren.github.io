The Science Citation Index (SCI) is a citation index originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and created by Eugene Garfield. It was officially launched in 1964. It is now owned by Thomson Reuters. The larger version (Science Citation Index Expanded) covers more than 6,500 notable and significant journals, across 150 disciplines, from 1900 to the present. These are alternately described as the world's leading journals of science and technology, because of a rigorous selection process. From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Citation_Index).

Even though SCI is very popular in China, but more than half foreign researchers didn't know what's SCI, especially in Computer science field. They just care about the toppest conferences all over the world, because it's really very fast to publish their research wrok. 

As for SCI, the first impression for many Chinese researchers is that: difficult to be published, long time to wait for reply, cost so much money. But they still work hard and published so many papers every year, because all the main factors for their promotion, NSF and salary is the amount of the SCI articles. Actually China has become worldâ€™s second-largest producer of SCI articles in 2014.


Many Chinese researchers who doing some research work in security field really did not know how many SCI journals and which are better. There are only one institute have a recommend SCI journal list[China Computer Federation](http://www.ccf.org.cn/sites/ccf/biaodan.jsp?contentId=2567814757428). But this is not enough for Chinese researchers, because there are so many researchers and maybe their papers's quality are not good. So I have analyzed all the security journals from [emuch journal list](http://emuch.net/bbs/journal.php?tag=%D0%C5%CF%A2%B0%B2%C8%AB), and make some notes about these journals as below:
